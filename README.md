# Learning C

As an Software Engineer that primarily works on JavaScript frontend applications I'm giving the low level language C a go.

I'm following [Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/) to get the basics down. After that I plan to move onto some simple projects then finally I want to make a little 2D game using C. If I enjoy that I'll look into some 3D stuff (because graphics programming sounds interesting). This is the repo I will use as a playground for learning.
